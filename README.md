# CIDataProject

This is the repository for the Data Visualization Project, Milestone Project II, for Code Institute's Full Stack Web Developer 
course. 

In this project, we will generate a visual representation of the Intentions of Vote for the 1989 Referendum in Chile, in which the country decided if the Dictator should stay (Yes) or go (No).

The data is obtained from Vincent Arel Bundock, France. Retrieved from https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html.

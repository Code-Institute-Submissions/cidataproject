# CIDataProject

This is the repository for the Data Visualization Project, Milestone Project II, for Code Institute's Full Stack Web Developer 
course. 

In this project, we will generate a visual representation of the victims of the Chilean Dictatorship lead by Augusto Pinochet 
between 1973 and 1989 in Chile.

The data is obtained from "Deaths and Disappearances in the Pinochet Regime: A New Dataset", by Meadowcroft, John & Freire, 
Danilo & Skarbek, David & Guerrero, Eugenia. (2017).

# CIDataProject

## Introduction

### This is the second Milestone Project for the Experience Centered Design Unit of the Full Stack Web Developer Course of Code Institute, credit-rated by Edinburgh Napier University
The objective of this project is to design and execute a Responsive, Interactive User Design Centered webpage through the use of Javascript logic. In this opportunity, the chosen format was a Data Visualization Dashboard


In this project, we will generate a visual representation of the Intentions of Vote for the 1988 Referendum in Chile, in which the country decided if the Dictator should stay (Yes) or go (No). 

The dataset was obtained from Vincent Arel Bundock, France. Retrieved from https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html. 


## The Dashboard

In this webpage, we can explore demographic trends of the 1988 Chilean Referendum Voting intentions. 


## Technologies

- The data is presented in charts made with the library DC.JS. 
- HMTL language for writting of the webpage layout
- CSS was used to customize the webpage design
- Bootstrap Framework was used to organize the webpage and uniform the layout throughout. Also, the spacing utils section has been creaated from the information in https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/spacing/
- Media Queries were used to control the responsive adjustments for smallest screens of the subtitles and paragraphs.
